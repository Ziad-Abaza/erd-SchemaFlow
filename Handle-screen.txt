To ensure an AI agent (like a coding assistant or a UI generator) understands exactly how to fix the layout, the prompt needs to be structured using Technical Constraints, Layout Hierarchy, and UI/UX Best Practices.

Here is the organized English prompt for your AI Agent:

Prompt: UI Refactoring & Layout Optimization
Objective
Redesign the current ERD Editor interface to eliminate element stacking, prevent overlapping tooltips, and maximize the usable canvas area. The goal is to move from a "scattered floating elements" model to a "structured workspace" model.

1. Layout Architecture (The "Shell")
Main Container: Implement a fixed-size viewport with overflow: hidden.

Sidebar (Right): Create a single, unified vertical sidebar (width: 280px-300px).

Consolidation: Move all utility buttons (Add Table, AI Table, Import, Export, Project Management) into this sidebar.

Grouping: Use collapsible sections (Accordions) for "Tools," "Import/Export," and "Project Settings."

Header or Status Bar: * Move the Validation Score and Auto-validate toggle to a thin top header or a bottom status bar.

Do not allow validation status to float freely over the canvas.

2. Fixing Element Overlap (Z-Index & Positioning)
Floating Action Buttons (FAB): Move the bottom-center controls (Undo/Redo/Save) to the Top-Center or integrate them into the Sidebar.

The "Tools" Menu Issue: Currently, the "Tools" popup opens upward and covers the Export buttons.

Fix: Replace floating popups with Side Drawers or ensures that z-index and bottom-padding prevent overlap with the Chat/Help widget.

Chat Widget: Relocate the Chat/Support bubble to the far bottom-right with a clear margin (e.g., bottom: 20px; right: 20px;) and ensure no other menus open behind or directly over it.

3. Canvas Optimization
Clearance: Ensure a "Safe Zone" of at least 40px around the edges of the canvas where no UI elements reside unless they are docked.

Responsive Scaling: The Sidebar should be collapsible to an icon-only view to give 100% width to the ERD canvas when needed.

4. Design System Specifications
Spacing: Use a consistent 8px grid system for margins and padding.

Visibility: Use a subtle background blur (backdrop-filter) for any remaining floating elements to separate them from the grid lines of the canvas.

Component Update: * Change the "Tools" dropdown to a Vertical Icon Menu within the sidebar.

Move the "Performance" and "Validation" buttons to a dedicated "Quality" tab in the sidebar.

Expected Outcome
The user should see a clean, unobstructed workspace in the center. All "Action" buttons are on the right, and all "Status" indicators are at the top/bottom. No menu should ever cover a button required to close or trigger that menu.
