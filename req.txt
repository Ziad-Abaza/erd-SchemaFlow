Please improve Smart Orthogonal Edges by implementing the following enhancements:

Automatic overlap avoidance: The relationship edges should intelligently avoid overlapping with tables and other edges to maintain a clean and readable diagram.

Auto-Routing: Edges should automatically recalculate and adjust their paths when tables are moved or resized.

Stable Connection Points: Ensure that edges consistently attach to logical and fixed connection points on tables (top, bottom, left, right) to improve visual consistency.

Editable Auto-Generated Edges: Allow users to manually edit Smart Orthogonal Edges that are automatically created when importing a .sql file. Currently, these edges are locked and cannot be adjusted, which limits usability and fine-tuning of the diagram.

These improvements will significantly enhance usability, flexibility, and overall diagram clarity.
